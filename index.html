      <p>
        Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who lived from
        1853 to 1890. He is widely considered to be one of the most important
        artists in the history of Western art.
      </p>
      <p class="py-5">
        Having only started painting at age 27, Van Gogh created over two
        thousand artworks in the ten years before he died, most of which were
        made in the last two years of his life. Van Gogh's work was
        characterized by his use of bold, vibrant colors, thick impasto, and
        dramatic, swirling brushstrokes.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is remembered as a tragic figure, having died by suicide at the young
        age of 37, but his legacy lives on as one of the most important and
        influential artists of all time. This is his story.

            used the asylums and their surrounding nature as inspiration for his
            works. Around this time, he wrote of "<i
              >...moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the
              veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart

            Indépendants in the Pavillon de la Ville de Paris on the
            Champs-Elysées - his paintings were said by Claude Monet to be the
            best in the showVan Gogh dies from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on
            July 29, 1890, at the age of 37. His final painting,
            <i>Wheatfield with Crows</i> was made just a few hours before his
            death. According to his brother Theo, Vincent's last words were "<i
              >The sadness will last forever</i
            >."

        "... to me Van Gogh is the finest painter of them all. Certainly the
        most popular, great painter of all time. The most beloved, his command
        of colour most magnificent. He transformed the pain of his tormented
        life into ecstatic beauty. Pain is easy to portray, but to use your
        passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our
        world, no one had ever done it before. Perhaps no one ever will again.
        To my mind, that strange, wild man who roamed the fields of Provence was
        not only the world's greatest artist, but also one of the greatest men
        who ever lived."
