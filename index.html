      <p>
        Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who lived from
        1853 to 1890. He is widely considered to be one of the most important
        artists in the history of Western art.
      </p>
      <p class="py-5">
        Having only started painting at age 27, Van Gogh created over two
        thousand artworks in the ten years before he died, most of which were
        made in the last two years of his life. Van Gogh's work was
        characterized by his use of bold, vibrant colors, thick impasto, and
        dramatic, swirling brushstrokes.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is remembered as a tragic figure, having died by suicide at the young
        age of 37, but his legacy lives on as one of the most important and
        influential artists of all time. This is his story.
